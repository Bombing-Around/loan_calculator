# Rust Loan Calculator

I have a thought in my head.

In the interest of continuing to toy with LLM's and learning Rust I thought I'd play around and see what I could come up with.

I want to ultimatley create a simple loan calculator that accepts, and prompts for missing, values and then output the missing variable

I have a few thoughts on what I want it to do but not a fully formed vision or anything.

Essentially: I'm just messin' around :laughing:
